Incomplete. Not sure if we will ask students to do a local install.

Getting started
===============

1. Launch a terminal (aka command line, command prompt). Instructions:
[OSX](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-to-the-mac-os-x-command-line) , [Windows](http://www.howtogeek.com/235101/10-ways-to-open-the-command-prompt-in-windows-10/)

	Things that we ask you to type into your terminal will be formatted like this:
	
	`$ cd`
	
	The `$` part represents what you will probably see leftmost in every line in the terminal. For example, on my terminal it shows `noura ~ $`. The `cd` is the part you actually type.

2. See if you already have Python installed.

	`$ python -V`
	
	If you have Python, this will tell you what version you have. If you do not have Python, you'll get an error message.

	If you do not have Python installed, install it. [instructions](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)

	If your Python version starts with 2 and is less than 2.
